# LiquiFusion AI — Real-Time Cross-Chain DeFi Risk Assessment & Fraud Prevention

---

## Overview

LiquiFusion AI is a decentralized, AI-powered platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain that provides real-time fraud detection and risk assessment for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions across multiple blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ICP. It leverages cutting-edge machine learning models running fully on-chain to detect and block suspicious or risky operations before they cause harm.

The platform also incorporates AI-driven database optimization to ensure fast and reliable data management, delivering a smooth, transparent, and secure DeFi experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time AI Fraud Detection:** AI models analyze every transaction instantly to detect anomalies, exploits, and scams.
- **Cross-Chain Security:** Protects DeFi assets on ICP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum via native Chain Key cryptography — no bridges needed.
- **On-Chain AI Inference:** ML models run inside ICP canisters, guaranteeing trustless, transparent, and auditable decisions.
- **Adaptive Threat Detection:** AI models are continuously retrained on emerging DeFi risks.
- **Database Performance Optimization:** AI-powered analytics monitor and optimize query performance and resource usage.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Interactive React frontend to monitor active pools, risk scores, security events, and system health.
- **ICP Authentication:** Secure login via Internet Identity.
- **Governance Support:** SNS DAO integration to manage AI model upgrades and policies transparently.
